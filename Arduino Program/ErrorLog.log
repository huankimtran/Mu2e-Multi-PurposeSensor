-Arduino does not go into setup
 +Ram overflowed? Reduce BUFF_SIZE to under 30 resolved the problem 
 +Pin 13 was overused. Pin 13 was already used by SPI but then was accidentally assigned as mode indicator
-Pc program always stuck when Arduino transfers second file

-The received data does not match with the real data on the SDCard

-Arduino file counter overflow when it reaches 255

-Testing increase the baudrate of Serial to 115200 and 460800 with SoftwareSerial. The connection was broken at 1000000 ( haven't tested the gap between 460800 and 1000000)
-The reading speed above 115200 seems not depends on the baudrate but the SDcard reading speed.
TODO-LIST
-Write a Serial speedometer program for linux and arduino
-Write a SDCard reading speedometer program for arduino
-Try to use buffer in reading of SDcard
-Try to use buffer in transferring data to PC
-Testing with HardwareSerial
-Testing with SDFat library
