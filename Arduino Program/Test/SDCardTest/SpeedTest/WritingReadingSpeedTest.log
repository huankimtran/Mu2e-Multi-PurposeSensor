ReadingSpeed2.ino (graphing reading speed arcording to buff read)
data saved in ReadingSpeedvsBufferSizeGraph.xls

Conclusion reading buff around 50 resulting in reading speed of 200kbs is
good enough
//------------------Writing-Test--------------------------------
Conclusion, full speed writing should be used with buffer with size of 50. This
yields writing speed of 100kbs
