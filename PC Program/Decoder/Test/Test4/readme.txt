To use the program, open the terminal and navigate to the folder that contains the program file (Decoder.out). Then use command:

./Decoder.out (put the path leading to the raw data file here)

Say if you already navigated to the folder containing the Decoder.out, and your raw data file named Trip2SanJac located at ~/Desktop/Trip2SanJac. Enter the command below to your terminal:

./Decoder.out ~/Desktop/Trip2SanJac

2 files named Trip2SanJac.acc containing the accleration data and Trip2SanJac.tmp containing the temperature data will be created in the same folder with the raw data file.

NOTE: THE PROGRAM MIGHT CRASH IF YOU GIVE IT A PATH CONTAINING SPACES. EX: a folder name "TRIP TO SANJAC" MIGHT CRASH THE PROGRAM.
